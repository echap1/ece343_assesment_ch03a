# ECE343 Ch 03a Assessment Problem 1

![graph](./wave.gif)

Here we can see the reverse traveling voltage on a lossy transmission line. When
viewed statically it is hard to see what is going on, so I generated this GIF with
matplotlib and Python. Since it is the reverse wave, it is traveling backwards. The 
wave is starting at the end of our transmission line and propagating towards the 
origin, losing magnitude in the process. The black dashed lines on the top and bottom
of the wave are the positive and negative exponential terms (without the cosine).
